## Summary
This tool is designed to help you get high scores for every game you make. The way the game works is this - every game you make is compared with the last best game you've made so far. If your game score is higher than the previous then you will get a high review score. Therefore the best way to play this game is to make small increases in game score every time. If you find your current game score is higher than neccessary, it is a good idea to leave some bugs in so that beating this score won't be as hard.

## Additional Info and Backstory
Since Cosmic Websites seemed to stop hosting this calculator, I decided to use the Wayback Machine and revive the website and host it on my own service.

For more info on how the game works [go to the wiki.](http://gamedevtycoon.wikia.com/) All credit for finding the formulas used in making this app goes to them. Way more credit goes to the man, the myth, the legend **Cosmic Websites** for originally creating the calculator and the general website, and R-SAAM Future Development for revising website design and re-hosting the website. Officially however, open source is the definitively superior way to continue the life of this project after 4 years of inactivity.
